        <h1>Kristall, Vertikal Accent</h1>
        <p>Gray in the day, lighted in the night. Outside Kulturhuset stands Crystal – Vertical Accent in glass and steel, or “the stick” and “the glass 
        obelisk” which it’s also called. It has become an icon for 
        Stockholm city, but many are not aware of the history and ideas behind it.
        <br><br>
        I have explored the website as a format, and how you can tell a story in an interesting way in mobile-format. I want the visual to add something to the reading experience. Depending on what time during the day it is, the colours changes, just like the sculpture does.

        <h1>Online Sharing</h1>
        <p>A website containing various investigations into sharing online. This is a group project together with Emelie Maxdotter & Jonathan Jervelind, where we did research on different subjects in online sharing, and did each different designs on the folders. I coded & designed the website in a way to present the folders visually. Visit the website here</p>

        <h1>En hälsning från havet</h1>
        <p>Greetings from the ocean.“I don’t need you, but you need me”. A visual interpretation of the Beijer Institute's research on the ocean. We are talking about thinking about the environment and the ocean as making nature a service, but it is actually humanity that will ultimately suffer the hardest. We consume the earth's assets at a rate that is not sustainable. Due to our lifestyle, species die, the climate and ecosystem die with major and sometimes unforeseen consequences. The sea does not need us, but we need a healthy, living sea to keep on living.</p>
